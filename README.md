Ref Use and definition
Here  ref is used to capture the input values from the form fields. When the form is submitted, the handleAddEducation and handleAddExperience functions use ref to get the values of the input fields and create a new education or experience object, respectively.

Similarly, in the Comp1 component, ref is used to get the values of the input fields when the form is submitted.

By using ref, we can access and modify the input field values programmatically, outside of the normal React data flow.

To Run The file use syntax: "npm start" In VS Studio
